# d3Charts
*Visualisations of data using d3, based on the freeCodeCamp curriculum*

See these projects live at [https://ailyntang.github.io/d3Charts/]()

My goal with these projects is to understand enough d3 so that I can move on to build a full stack project. So even though it kills me to have such ugly charts, I am deliberately avoiding CSS for these projects to prioritise my time for other things.

Also, I am aware that not all the freeCodeCamp tests are passing. The failed tests are those which I deem as design decisions, rather than those testing an accurate implementation of the d3 library.

For example, in the bar chart project, I chose to convert the date string "1950-01-01" to a real date, using `new Date("1950-01-01")`. The test failed, as it was looking for a string rather than a `Date`. I chose to let this fail rather than refactor my code. Doing my best to prioritise my time effectively for learning, rather than perfectionism in an imperfect, codenewbie world.
